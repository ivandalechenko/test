<br>
                <br>3.2
                <br>If you are accepting these Terms of Use on behalf of a legal entity (i.e., a company or other legal entity), you represent that you have the authority to bind that legal entity to these Terms of Use and that you have provided access to all email addresses, passwords, and credentials for accessing the Software to other authorized representatives of the legal entity. If you do not have such authority, you are not entitled to access or use the Software.
<br>
                <br>3.3
                <br>Before registering, you are solely responsible for ensuring that the use of the Software in your jurisdiction is allowed under applicable law. If such use is prohibited by law, you are not entitled to access or use the Software.
<br>
                <br>3.4
                <br>To register, create a Client Account, and access the Software, you must follow the steps below:
<br>
                <br>3.4.1
                <br>Sign up. Fill out the registration form, providing your email address and password. You will have the opportunity to review the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. You may access the documents through the provided links and acknowledge them. Before clicking "Sign Up" to proceed with the registration process, you must confirm your acceptance of these Terms of Use and your review of our Privacy Policy. Additionally, you must confirm that you are at least 18 years old. After clicking "Sign Up," your account ("Client Account") is created. The latter method requires you to also comply with the terms and privacy policy of such third-party service.
<br>
                <br>3.4.2
                <br>Once TradeCoinAi provides you with a Client Account to access and use the Software, the registration process will be completed. The Client Account is provided to you free of charge. TradeCoinAi has the right to refuse to provide you with a Client Account at its discretion, and in such case, you must not use the Software.
<br>
                <br>3.4.3
                <br>You may interrupt the registration process at any time and/or suspend the process and resume it later. You may review for any errors in the entered information and, if necessary, correct them by modifying the input.
<br>
                <br>3.4.4
                <br>After creating your Client Account, you will be prompted to complete the profile of your Client Account, and you will be guided through various steps, including connecting your Client Account to an existing cryptocurrency exchange account.
<br>
                <br>3.4.5
                <br>Connecting to a cryptocurrency exchange account. To utilize the features of the Software, you must have an account on a cryptocurrency exchange ("Exchange Account") (e.g., Binance, Huobi, Coinbase, etc.). If you do not have an exchange account, you may choose to register directly on the website of the cryptocurrency exchange provider or through the link provided in our "My Exchanges" tab, which will direct you to the website of the selected cryptocurrency exchange provider. In any case, you acknowledge that you are entering into separate legal relations with the chosen cryptocurrency exchange provider, and you are bound by their specific terms.
<br>
                <br>To connect your exchange account to your Client Account, you must log into your account, create an API key and API secret, then return to your dashboard and input the API key and API secret. Before clicking "Connect Exchange," you must confirm that the Exchange Account belongs to you personally and that you are not connecting someone else's account. Once you complete this step, your account will be displayed on the tab.
<br>
                <br>Depending on the subscription type you choose (for more information on Plans, refer to Section 7), you can connect either one exchange account from one cryptocurrency exchange or multiple exchange accounts from one cryptocurrency exchange to your Client Account. Subject to the above, you may link exchange account(s) from multiple cryptocurrency exchanges to your Client Account.
<br>
                <br>Under certain circumstances, we may remove API keys for security purposes, which will require you to reconnect to your exchange account.
<br>
                <br>3.5
                <br>During the registration process, you will be required to provide us with certain information, such as your email address and password. For further information about the data we collect, please refer to our Privacy Policy at https://tradecoinai.com/privacy-policy. You must provide accurate, current, and complete information about yourself and promptly update all information in your Client Account to ensure that your Client Account is accurate, current, and complete. You may update or change the settings of your Client Account at any time.
<br>
                <br>3.6
                <br>Depending on the exchange account you use, we may automatically register you to participate in trading competitions organized for your benefit. Such competitions do not require your active participation in the contest or any additional actions. Registration for trading competitions does not cause any financial harm to you. When we organize trading competitions, we send you information in advance about the terms and details of the competition. We may request additional data for prize distribution, which is voluntary, and you have the right to refuse, but in such case, your prize will be forfeited.

<br>
                <br>4.1.2
                <br>Failure to comply with the limits of the purpose and permitted use of your Client Account and Software (including in the event of us detecting any activity related to managing multiple exchange accounts from the same cryptocurrency exchange accounts through your personal Client Account without subscribing to the corresponding Plan) shall be deemed a material breach of these Terms of Use. TradeCoinAi has the right - without prejudice to any other rights - to terminate the operation of your Client Account in accordance with Sections 12.3.2 and 12.3.3.

                <br>7. Purchasing a Subscription Plan
<br>
                <br>7.1
                <br>When registering to receive the Services, you have the option to choose between different subscription plans, i.e., "Basic," "Al Pro," "Al Premium," collectively referred to as "Plans" or "Subscription."
<br>
                <br>7.2
                <br>Detailed descriptions of TradeCoinAi subscriptions, including prices and features associated with each subscription type, are available on the "Plans" page or in the Help Center. TradeCoinAi reserves the right to modify the subscriptions published on the "Plans" page (e.g., adding or removing plans) at any time. TradeCoinAi will attempt to notify those who may be affected by such actions.
<br>
                <br>7.2.1
                <br>Subscriptions available on the "Plans" page are governed by these Terms of Use. By accepting these Terms of Use, you also acknowledge your agreement with the terms of the subscription features as described on the "Plans" page.
<br>
                <br>7.3
                <br>TradeCoinAi reserves the right, at its discretion, to provide Services to Customers based on individual plans ("Individual Plans"). Individual plans will not be displayed on the "Plans" page and will be offered to customers on an individual basis. Individual plans are governed by these Terms of Use.
<br>
                <br>7.4
                <br>To purchase a subscription other than an Individual Plan, select the subscription you wish to purchase on the "Plans" page of our website or the "Subscription" tab in your Client Account and choose your preferred payment method. All payments made using debit/credit cards and Paypal are processed by our registered seller - cryptocloud.plus. By purchasing a subscription using any of the specified payment methods, you also enter into an agreement with cryptocloud.plus. Your relationship with cryptocloud is governed by cryptocloud's Terms and Conditions, available at https://cryptocloud.plus/legal-buyers. Before clicking the "Pay" button, you must confirm that you accept these Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy. Additionally, you must confirm that you are at least 18 years old and agree to receive subscription features at the time of the Purchase Agreement. The selection of the subscription, the subscription period (e.g., month or year), and the provision of your payment information constitute an offer to enter into a contract with TradeCoinAi for the use of Software features provided under the chosen Subscription based on these Terms of Use, as described in Section 3.4 ("Purchase Agreement"). The offer must be accepted by us. We may not accept the offer at our discretion. The Purchase Agreement will be concluded at the moment you receive confirmation from us or when we activate the selected Subscription features, as described below. TradeCoinAi will not store the text of the Purchase Agreement after the conclusion of the Purchase Agreement. However, the text of the Purchase Agreement will be accessible to you on the "Terms of Use" page in a downloadable format. The provisions described in Sections 3.4.2 and 3.4.3 above apply to this Purchase Agreement to the extent not stated otherwise in this Section 7. The term of the Purchase Agreement is the subscription period chosen by you, and the termination provisions of Section 12 apply to it.
<br>
                <br>7.5
                <br>If you wish to upgrade your Subscription, you can do so at any time on the "Subscription" tab in your Client Account. Your new subscription will start after the payment is processed. Your new Subscription will be activated immediately upon processing your payment, regardless of the remaining time of your old Subscription. Placing an order for a new Subscription will result in the immediate termination of the Purchase Agreement regarding your old Subscription and the conclusion of a new Purchase Agreement for the new Subscription. Any funds you may have remaining from your old Subscription will be calculated towards your new Subscription, meaning you will only pay the difference between your new Subscription payment and the remaining funds unused within the old Subscription. For termination of the Purchase Agreement, refer to Section 12.4.

<br>
                <br>11.1
                <br>TradeCoinAi may provide you with updates, including:
<br>
                <br>11.1.1
                <br>Enhancements. From time to time, digital content requires refinement and adaptation to new technical capabilities or changes in the user environment/infrastructure. To the extent that this does not adversely affect the subjective or objective requirements of compliance with the Software or your access or use of the Software (e.g., adaptation or additional services, features, links, integration of additional (module) services, or redesign and recompilation of services, as well as changes to the name and appearance of the Software), TradeCoinAi is not obliged to provide enhancements.
<br>
                <br>11.1.2
                <br>Debugging. TradeCoinAi will provide you with updates, including security updates that contain fixes that ensure compliance of the Software with subjective or objective requirements, including legal, regulatory, and judicial requirements, for the duration of your use of the Software. TradeCoinAi will inform you of the availability of debugging updates and the consequences of being unable to install such updates, as well as provide you with installation instructions. This section 11.1.2 in no way limits your means of legal protection in the event of non-compliance as set forth in section 11.2.
<br>
                <br>11.1.3
                <br>Modifications. TradeCoinAi may provide you with updates containing modifications to the Software that go beyond what is necessary to maintain compliance with the Software. TradeCoinAi may make changes if (a) the features of the Software or its components are no longer used to the extent that justifies their maintenance and continuation, (b) (new or modified) legal, regulatory, or judicial requirements necessitate adjustments to the Software that would be economically impracticable for TradeCoinAi, or (c) changes in the technical conditions of the environment or infrastructure of the Software are beyond the control of TradeCoinAi and complicate the maintenance and further operation of the Software to an extent that would be economically impracticable for TradeCoinAi. TradeCoinAi will inform you of any changes. If a Modification adversely affects your access to or use of the Software and the impact is more than negligible, the following applies to such information: please note whether you can maintain the Software without the Modification or if you have the right to terminate the agreement in accordance with section 12.3 of these Terms of Use.
<br>
                <br>11.2
                <br>Remedies for non-compliance
<br>
                <br>11.2.1 In the event of non-compliance of the Software, you have the right to bring the Software into compliance with the terms set forth in these Terms of Use, for example, through an update. If (1) TradeCoinAi refuses or is unable to ensure compliance within a reasonable period of time and without significant inconvenience to you, (2) or if the non-compliance is so significant that it is not reasonable for you to first submit a request for correction, you have the right to (a) a proportionate reduction in price, if applicable, for the period of time during which the digital content or digital service did not comply with the requirements, and (b) if the non-compliance is not insignificant, terminate the agreement in accordance with section 13.3. The price reduction or refund shall be proportionate if it reflects the decrease in the value of the Software compared to the value the digital content or digital service would have had if it had complied with the requirements.
<br>
                <br>11.2.2 To enforce your rights in accordance with Section 11, you may contact TradeCoinAi customer support. Contact information for customer support: support@tradecoinai.com.

<br>
                <br>12.2.3
                <br>if your actions or inactions related to the use of the Software impede or hinder the normal operation of the Software or otherwise cause or may cause harm, damage, or other detrimental consequences to the Software, TradeCoinAi, or other users of the Software;
